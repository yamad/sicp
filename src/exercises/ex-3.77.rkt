;; Exercise 3.77: The `integral' procedure used above was analogous to
;; the "implicit" definition of the infinite stream of integers in
;; section 3-5-2.  Alternatively, we can give a definition of
;; `integral' that is more like `integers-starting-from' (also in
;; section 3-5-2):
;;
;; When used in systems with loops, this procedure has the same
;; problem as does our original version of `integral'.  Modify the
;; procedure so that it expects the `integrand' as a delayed argument
;; and hence can be used in the `solve' procedure shown above.

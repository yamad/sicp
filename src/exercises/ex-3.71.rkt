;; Exercise 3.71: Numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two
;; cubes in more than one way are sometimes called "Ramanujan
;; numbers", in honor of the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.(6)
;; Ordered streams of pairs provide an elegant solution to the problem
;; of computing these numbers.  To find a number that can be written
;; as the sum of two cubes in two different ways, we need only
;; generate the stream of pairs of integers (i,j) weighted according
;; to the sum i^3 + j^3 (Exercise 3-70), then search the stream for
;; two consecutive pairs with the same weight.  Write a procedure to
;; generate the Ramanujan numbers.  The first such number is 1,729.
;; What are the next five?

No. `interleave` does not have lazy evaluation so all arguments are
evaluated immediately when called. This results in an infinite loop
where `pairs` forces evaluation of itself on infinite streams .

Note the second argument to `interleave` `in LR's `pairs' procedure is
a recursive call to `pairs`, which then calls `interleave`, which then
evaluates `pairs`, which then calls `interleave`.
